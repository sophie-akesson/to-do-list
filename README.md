# Todo

A basic to do list using vanilla JS. This is the first assignment in Javascript at Medieinstitutet. 

## Data

LocalStorage is used to store data.

## Requirements

- Git
- Node

##  Install & run

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/Sjukhus/to-do-list.git
```

```
npm install
```

Make sure to use Chrome if you run the project in a local environment. Chrome is at the time (10/11/2020) the only browser which allows use of LocalStorage locally.
